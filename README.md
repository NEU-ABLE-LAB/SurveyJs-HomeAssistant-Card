The target of this tutorial is to show minimal steps to be done to get hello
world output from a card written all by yourself. The setup is still done
manually to understand the technical requirements. More advanced solutions will
be covered by future tutorials. Please understand minimal as a reasonable
minimum to get started, not as the absolute minimum.

## Prerequisites

* [Development Environment](https://github.com/home-assistant-tutorials/01.development-environment)

## Cloning the Repository

You may clone this repository into your workspace and follow along.
Alternatively you may want to write the code yourself, to get a deeper effect of
learning. Just decide what works best for you.

Fork the repository on Github into your own instance. Open the workspace
directory in the command-line. Call `git clone <URL>`. Use the `URL` Github does
give you, when you click the button `Code`. If your setup is well done, you
should prefer `SSH` over `HTTPS`. This allows you to easily push to your
repository.
